# Deployment Guide for Teacher's Tutorial Hub

This guide provides instructions for deploying your Teacher's Tutorial Hub website to make it publicly accessible to your students.

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free and Easy)

1. **Create a GitHub account** if you don't have one already at [github.com](https://github.com)

2. **Create a new repository**
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "tutorial-hub")
   - Make it public
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Upload your files**
   - You can either use GitHub Desktop, Git commands, or the web interface
   - For the web interface:
     - Click "uploading an existing file" link
     - Drag and drop all your website files
     - Commit the changes

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "main branch"
   - Click "Save"
   - GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is published

5. **Access your website**
   - Your website will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`
   - Share this URL with your students

## Option 2: Netlify (Free with Premium Options)

1. **Create a Netlify account** at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)

2. **Deploy your site**
   - Click "New site from Git" if you're using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
   - Or click "Sites" and then "Drag and drop your site folder here"
   - If using drag and drop, simply select all your website files and drop them

3. **Configure your site**
   - Netlify will automatically detect that it's a static HTML site
   - No additional configuration is needed for this simple website

4. **Access your website**
   - Netlify will provide you with a random URL (e.g., `random-name-123456.netlify.app`)
   - You can customize this under "Site settings" > "Change site name"
   - For a custom domain, go to "Domain settings" (premium feature)

## Option 3: Traditional Web Hosting

1. **Choose a web hosting provider**
   - Popular options include Bluehost, HostGator, DreamHost, or SiteGround
   - Look for plans that support static websites (most basic plans will work)

2. **Purchase a domain name** (optional)
   - You can usually purchase this through your hosting provider
   - Or use a domain registrar like Namecheap or Google Domains

3. **Upload your files**
   - Log in to your hosting control panel (often cPanel)
   - Look for the File Manager or FTP access
   - Upload all your website files to the public_html or www directory

4. **Access your website**
   - Your website will be available at your domain name or the hosting provider's assigned address
   - Share this URL with your students

## Important Security Considerations

1. **Change the default admin password**
   - Open `app.js` and locate the login authentication section
   - Change the hardcoded username and password to something secure
   - For example, change `if (username === 'admin' && password === 'password123')` to your preferred credentials

2. **For a production environment**
   - Consider implementing a more robust authentication system
   - In a real-world scenario, you would want to use a backend server with proper authentication

## Maintenance and Updates

To update your website after deployment:

1. Make changes to your local files
2. Re-upload the modified files to your hosting service
3. For GitHub Pages and Netlify, simply commit and push your changes or re-upload the files

## Need More Features?

If you need more advanced features like:
- Database storage for content
- More robust user authentication
- File uploads for images or documents

Consider upgrading to a dynamic website with a backend. Options include:
- WordPress (easy to use, many plugins)
- A custom solution with Node.js, PHP, or Python
- Content Management Systems like Ghost or Strapi
